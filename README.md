# SpaceEscape

This game was created as a part of my thesis for Politechnika CzÄ™stochowska.

# Description

The game is a 3D puzzle solver in low-poly style revoled around controlling your surroundings via computer console. 

The goal of this project was to create an interesting environment that could bring the aspect of programming/using console closer to people that had never used it. 
The puzzles are progresively getting more and more difficult to test your logical thinking and knowledge gained while playing.

- Autosave is currently the only option to save your progress
- Simple level loading system


# Things to come:
