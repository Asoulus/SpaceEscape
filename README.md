# SpaceEscape

This game was created as a part of my thesis for Politechnika CzÄ™stochowska.

The game is a 3D puzzle solver in low-poly style revoled around controlling your surroundings via computer console. 

The goal of this project was to create an interesting environment that could bring the aspect of programming/using console closer to people that had never used it. 
The puzzles are progresively getting more and more difficult to test your logical thinking and knowledge gained while playing.


Current state of the game:
- two fully playable levels showcasing game's potencial
- autosave is currently the only option to save your progress
- simple level loading system


Things to come:
- more levels
- better saving/loading system
- more puzzles/mechanics
- better lighting
- better graphics
